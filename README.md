# SudokuSolver
This script will solve Sudoku puzzles live. Each time it runs, it creates a new, unsolved Sudoku puzzle that only has one unique solution. It does this by creating a fully solved puzzle, and then systematically removing random cells until the conditions are met. There is a live window using Pygame to visualize the solving process. The original unsolved puzzle will show up in red and then the black numbers will be the backtracking algorithm working to solve the puzzle. The backtracking algorithm works by trying a potential value in an empty cell and then proceeding forward. If it encounters a conflict that makes the current solution invalid, it will backtrack to the last valid state. Once the puzzle is solved, the black numbers will become green and the process is repeated again with a new puzzle.
